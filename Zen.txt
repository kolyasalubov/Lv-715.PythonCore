Zen of Python!

1.Beautiful is better than ugly.
2.Explicit is better than implicit.
3.Simple is better than complex.

7.Readability counts.

16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
19.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
50.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
